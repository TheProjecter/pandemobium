RUNNING PANDEMOBIUM FROM AN ECLIPSE-BASED IDE

First, download the Android SDK and ADT plug-in to enable the
Android emulator. Follow the instructions for installing and setting
up the SDK and ADT Plug-in on your Eclipse-based IDE located at 
http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html. If working on Windows
64 bit versions, save trouble by installing the SDK on a path without
spaces. Next, import the PandemobiumStockTrader project into your
favorite IDE's workspace. Here are instructions for Eclipse:
Right click inside of the package explorer (usually on the left-hand 
 side of the workbench), select import, choose "Exisiting Projects into Workspace" 
 inside the "General" folder as the import source, then select the location of the 
"PandemobiumStockTrader" root directory. In the Project Explorer, right
click the PandemobiumStockTrader project and click properties, then
select Android. Select the appropriate Android target platform, 
(Google API 2.2 is recommended). In the StockTrader web service application, 
make sure that the Java JDK(Java Development Kit) and servlet-api.jar included in the build path.
The servlet-api.jar can be found the in lib folder of the Tomcat 
installation directory, (See below on how install Tomcat.) To add the JDK to
the build path, right click the StockTrader application and select
properties, select the Java Build Path menu, then the Libraries tab.
Click add Library, select JRE System Library and check default 
workspace JRE. To add the servlet-api.jar, in the same Libraries tab,
select add Library, click add User Library, click add User Libraries,
click New, name the new library, then add the servlet.jar file to the
library. Press Ok then check the new library that was created then click
ok. The new library should now appear under the Libraries tab.
In the main menu bar, under the Project menu, select Clean to clean both
projects to clear any errors. 

Finally, if you have set the window preferences to Android, now select
the PandemobiumStockTrader in the package explorer, and then choose 
Run->Run As->Android Application. This will start the SDK manager where
you can choose a virtual device or create a new one. This device will 
have the PandemobiumStockTrader application loaded into its application
menu.

If you get this error when deploying to the Android emulator: 
[... - Emulator] invalid command-line parameter: Files.
[... - Emulator] Hint: use '@foo' to launch a virtual device named 'foo'.
[... - Emulator] please use -help for more information
Do this:
In Eclipse go to Window -> Preferences -> Android
if your SDK path is for example D:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk 
change to this D:\PROGRA~2\Android\android-sdk and apply.
Removing the spaces in the path should fix the problem.




INSTALLING AND RUNNING PANDEMOBIUM USING ONLY IT's .apk FILE

First, download the Android SDK so you can run the Android emulator:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
Next, put the .apk file inside the "(sdk-location)\platform-tools\" 
folder. Using the SDK Manager, after installing the suggested packages, 
create an Android device.  I recommend using the Google API platform 
2.2, but every package should work with Pandemobium.
Once your device is created, run it.
Inside the command prompt, cd into "(sdk-location)\platform-tools\".
Now, run this command "adb -e install -r PandemobiumStockTrader.apk".  
If the PandemobiumStockTrader.apk file is in the platform-tools folder, 
and your Android emulator is running, the Pandemobium app will be 
installed into your device, and appear in the app section of your 
virtual device.

INSTALLING TOMCAT AND RUNNING WEB SERVICES

(1) Download Tomcat binary distribution at:
http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi
(2) Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location
- typically to reside in its own directory named "apache-tomcat-7.x"
(3) Copy WAR file from PANDEMOBIUM_HOME\bin into TOMCAT_HOME\webapps
(4) Start Tomcat either through your ide if it is configured correctly,
 or run the appropriate startup file for your OS in TOMCAT_HOME\bin
NOTE: Either JAVA_HOME or JRE_HOME environment variables must be set
before starting tomcat from the command line)

NOTE: If running on Android device, and not emulator, the IP address
for the services (including account_service, trade_service, tip_service,
and tip_list) must be changed under
PANDEMOBIUM_HOME\Android\res\values\strings.xml
